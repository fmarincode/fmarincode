### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Florent, a young developer since February 2023. I started with a training course that allowed me to create projects, discover group projects and develop my skills. 
âš¡ I'm currently learning React, Node, Tailwind... and today I'd like to give you a link to my portfolio: https://florentmarin.com/ 
If you're a recruiter and you're interested in my profile, you should know that I'm looking for my first job as a developer!
